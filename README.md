 Login Experiment – Context API & Redux Toolkit
Project Overview
This project is a React-based web application developed to demonstrate modern state management techniques using: React Context API for Authentication & Role Management Redux Toolkit for Product Catalog and Cart State Management The application supports role-based access control, where Admin and User have different permissions.

Objectives
Implement authentication using Context API Manage global application state using Redux Toolkit Apply role-based authorization (Admin vs User) Separate concerns between authentication state and application data Deploy the application with a live production link

Stores product catalog Actions: Add product (Admin only) Remove product (Admin only)

Cart Slice
Stores user-specific cart items Actions: Add to cart (User only) Remove from cart (User only) Redux ensures predictable and scalable state updates.

Conclusion
